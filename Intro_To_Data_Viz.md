Thank you for having me!

Please post your questions to the chat (if there is one), or some other means...

We have 25-30 mins 
Framework for how to think about Data Visualization so that 
You can ask yourself critical questions about your data and how you want to communicate with it. 

No longer start these presentations by asking who has heard about Data Viz, it is a commonplace term now. 

## Who am I and what are we going to talk about?

Stephen Boyd. Information Design and Data Visualization Specialist. I run a data design practice. You can find me online at @sspboyd.

We're going to cover 

## What is Data Visualization at a conceptual level?

- Encoding and Decoding
  - The first part is data visualization design, the second part is within the audience. 

### What are the steps?
- Acquire
- Parse
- Filter
- Mine
- Represent
- Refine
- Interact



## What Makes a Data Viz effective?

When the information or experience you want to convey is understood by the intended audience.

- Facts and Insights
- Explore and Discover
- Experiential 

### What are you communicating and to whom? 
   - Who is going to be using this chart and why
   - What questions does your audience want to answer? 
   - What decisions need to be made based on this information?
   - Are you leaving the audience with facts or impressions?


## Data Ethics: No Data is created equal.
What is your data's biography?

- Who collected the data?
- What was their motivation? (who paid for it??)
- How was it collected and prepped or analyzed before you received it?

## Tips
- Does it work in black and white? It is a good test to see if you have clearly stated your case. 
- List your assumptions and data sources. Footnotes galore. 
- What type of chart should I use??

- Demystify coding! Try creative coding, just to see what it's like.
  - [Processing.org](http://Processing.org) and [P5.js](http://P5js.org). In 2 mins you can make something react to your mouse.
