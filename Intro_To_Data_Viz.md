## Who am I and what are we going to talk about?

Stephen Boyd. Information Design and Data Visualization Specialist. I run a data design practice. You can find me online at @sspboyd.

We are going to cover how to think about Data Visualizations so that you can ask yourself critical questions about your data and how you want to communicate with it. 


## What is Data Visualization at a conceptual level?

- Encoding and Decoding
  - The first part is data visualization design, the second part is within the audience. 

### What are the steps?
With credit to [Ben Fry](https://www.benfry.com/), here is his take on the data visualization development stages.

- Acquire
- Parse
- Filter
- Mine
- Represent
- Refine
- Interact

## What Makes a Data Viz effective?
When the information or experience you want to convey is understood by the intended audience.

- Facts and Insights
- Explore and Discover
- Experiential 

### What are you communicating and to whom? 
- Who is going to be using this chart and why
- What questions does your audience want to answer? 
- What decisions need to be made based on this information?
- Are you leaving the audience with facts or impressions?

## Data Ethics: No Data is created equal.
Definitely check out Heather Krause's DataAssist's blog about data ethics, [We All Count](https://idatassist.com/we-all-count/)

What is your data biography?
- Who collected the data?
- What was their motivation? (who paid for it??)
- How was it collected and prepped or analyzed before you received it?

## Tips
- List your assumptions and data sources. Footnotes galore. 
- Does your visualization work in black and white? It is a good test to see if you have clearly stated your case. 
- What type of chart should I use?? Checkout [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) as a useful starting point. 
- Demystify coding! Try creative coding, just to see what it's like. [Processing.org](http://Processing.org) and [P5.js](http://P5js.org) are the best places to start. In two minutes you can code something that reacts to your mouse movement.
